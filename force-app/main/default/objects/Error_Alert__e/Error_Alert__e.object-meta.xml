  >Platform Event for publishing error alerts from onboarding processes to external systems or monitoring tools. High-volume event that can be subscribed to by other Salesforce processes, external integrations, or monitoring dashboards. Example: When a critical error occurs during status evaluation (e.g., rule evaluation failure), the system might publish an Error_Alert__e event with error details, context information, and correlation IDs. External monitoring systems can subscribe to these events via Streaming API to receive real-time error notifications. This enables distributed error handling and centralized logging without tight coupling between components. The event is published immediately (PublishImmediately) for real-time alerting.</description>
