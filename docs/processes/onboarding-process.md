# Onboarding Process

## Overview

The onboarding process is a metadata-driven workflow that guides users through structured stages to complete vendor program onboarding. The process is fully configurable through Custom Objects and supports progress tracking, auditability, and dynamic component rendering.

## Process Flow

```
1. User initiates onboarding from Vendor Program record
   ↓
2. System resolves Onboarding_Application_Process__c for Vendor Program
   ↓
3. onboardingFlowEngine or onboardingApplicationFlow loads stages from Onboarding_Application_Stage__c
   ↓
4. For each stage:
   a. onboardingStageRenderer renders stage component using static conditional rendering
   b. User completes stage actions
   c. Stage component fires 'next' event
   d. Progress is upserted to Onboarding_Application_Progress__c (onboardingFlowEngine only)
   e. Stage completion is logged to Onboarding_Application_Stage_Completion__c (onboardingFlowEngine only)
   ↓
5. Process completes when all stages are finished
```

## Stage Components

### 1. Vendor Selection (`vendorProgramOnboardingVendor`)
- Select or create a vendor account
- Validates vendor exists and is active

### 2. Vendor Program Search/Create (`vendorProgramOnboardingVendorProgramSearchOrCreate`)
- Search for existing vendor program
- Option to create new vendor program

### 3. Vendor Program Create (`vendorProgramOnboardingVendorProgramCreate`)
- Create a new vendor program record
- Set program details and configuration

### 4. Vendor Program Group (`vendorProgramOnboardingVendorProgramGroup`)
- Assign a program group to the vendor program
- Links requirements and rules

### 5. Vendor Program Requirement Group (`vendorProgramOnboardingVendorProgramRequirementGroup`)
- Assign requirement groups
- Defines what requirements must be completed

### 6. Vendor Program Recipient Group (`vendorProgramOnboardingVendorProgramRecipientGroup`)
- Assign recipient groups
- Defines who receives onboarding communications

### 7. Recipient Group Configuration (`vendorProgramOnboardingRecipientGroup`)
- Configure recipient group details
- Set group parameters

### 8. Recipient Group Members (`vendorProgramOnboardingRecipientGroupMembers`)
- Add members to recipient group
- Assign contacts to group

### 9. Required Credentials (`vendorProgramOnboardingRequiredCredentials`)
- Configure required credentials
- Set credential requirements

### 10. Training Requirements (`vendorProgramOnboardingTrainingRequirements`)
- Configure training requirements
- Set training assignments

## Progress Tracking

### Onboarding_Application_Progress__c

Tracks the current state of an onboarding process:
- `Current_Stage__c` - Current stage ID
- `Onboarding_Application_Process__c` - Process being executed
- `Vendor_Program__c` - Vendor program being onboarded

### Onboarding_Application_Stage_Completion__c

Audit log of completed stages:
- `Completed_Date__c` - Timestamp of completion
- `Completed_By__c` - User who completed the stage
- `Onboarding_Application_Stage__c` - Completed stage

## Resuming Progress

Users can resume onboarding from where they left off:
1. System loads `Onboarding_Application_Progress__c` for the vendor program
2. Finds the `Current_Stage__c` in the stage list
3. Sets `activeStageIndex` to the saved stage
4. User continues from that point

## Configuration

### Creating an Onboarding Process

1. **Create Process**: Create `Onboarding_Application_Process__c` record
   - Set Name and Description
   - Set Active = true

2. **Create Component Library Entries**: Create `Onboarding_Component_Library__c` records
   - Set `Component_API_Name__c` to LWC component API name (e.g., "vendorProgramOnboardingVendor")
   - Set Name and Description

3. **Create Stages**: Create `Onboarding_Application_Stage__c` records
   - Set `Onboarding_Application_Process__c` to process
   - Set `Onboarding_Component_Library__c` to component
   - Set `Display_Order__c` for sequence
   - Set `Label__c` for display
   - Set `Required__c` if stage is mandatory
   - Optionally set `Next_Stage__c` for branching

4. **Assign Process**: Link process to Vendor Program via `Onboarding_Application_Progress__c`

## Branching Logic

Stages can support branching by setting `Next_Stage__c`:
- If `Next_Stage__c` is set, flow advances to that stage
- If not set, flow advances to next stage in `Display_Order__c`
- Allows conditional stage progression

## Event Handling

### Navigation Events

Stage components communicate with the flow engine via custom events:

**Next Event:**ascript
this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('next', { 
  detail: { /* stage-specific data */ } 
}));**Back Event:**ascript
this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('back', { 
  detail: { /* stage-specific data */ } 
}));### Context Passing

Stage components receive context:
{
  vendorProgramId: String,  // Current vendor program ID
  stageId: String          // Current stage ID
}## Error Handling

- **Missing Process**: If no process found, displays error message
- **Missing Stages**: If no stages found, displays error message
- **Component Not Found**: If component API name invalid, logs error
- **Progress Save Failure**: Logs error but allows user to continue

## Best Practices

1. **Stage Independence**: Each stage should be self-contained
2. **Data Validation**: Validate data before firing 'next' event
3. **Progress Persistence**: Always save progress after stage completion
4. **Error Messages**: Provide clear error messages to users
5. **Loading States**: Show loading indicators during async operations

Back Event:
this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('back', { 
  detail: { /* stage-specific data */ } 
}));em that automatically evaluates and updates onboarding status based on requirement completion. It uses a configurable rules engine that supports multiple evaluation logic types.

## Architecture

Context Passing
Stage components receive context:

{
  vendorProgramId: String,  // Current vendor program ID
  stageId: String          // Current stage ID
}uation logic:

**Key Fields:**
- `Vendor_Program_Group__c` - Associated vendor program group
- `Target_Onboarding_Status__c` - Status to set when rule passes
- `Evaluation_Logic__c` - Logic type: "ALL", "ANY", or "CUSTOM"
- `Custom_Evaluation_Logic__c` - Custom expression (if Evaluation_Logic__c = "CUSTOM")

### Onboarding_Status_Rule__c

Individual rule conditions:

**Key Fields:**
- `Parent_Rule__c` - Parent rules engine
- `Requirement__c` - Requirement to evaluate (Vendor_Program_Requirement__c)
- `Expected_Status__c` - Expected requirement status (e.g., "Complete", "Approved")
- `Rule_Number__c` - Order of evaluation (used in custom expressions)

## Evaluation Logic Types

### ALL (AND Logic)

All rules must pass for the engine to pass.

**Example:**
- Rule 1: Requirement A = "Complete" ✓
- Rule 2: Requirement B = "Complete" ✓
- Rule 3: Requirement C = "Approved" ✓
- **Result**: Rule passes (all conditions met)

### ANY (OR Logic)

At least one rule must pass for the engine to pass.

**Example:**
- Rule 1: Requirement A = "Complete" ✗
- Rule 2: Requirement B = "Complete" ✓
- Rule 3: Requirement C = "Approved" ✗
- **Result**: Rule passes (at least one condition met)

### CUSTOM (Expression Logic)

Uses a custom expression with rule numbers.

**Expression Syntax:**
- Use rule numbers (e.g., "1", "2", "3")
- Operators: `AND`, `OR`
- Parentheses for grouping
- Case-insensitive

**Examples:**
Error Handling
Missing Process: If no process found, displays error message
Missing Stages: If no stages found, displays error message
Component Not Found: If component API name invalid, logs error
Progress Save Failure: Logs error but allows user to continue
Best Practices
Stage Independence: Each stage should be self-contained
Data Validation: Validate data before firing 'next' event
Progress Persistence: Always save progress after stage completion
Error Messages: Provide clear error messages to users
Loading States: Show loading indicators during async operations
