# Onboarding Home Dashboard Component

## Overview

The `onboardingHomeDashboard` component provides a comprehensive command center for Dealer and Vendor Program onboarding activities. It offers role-based views, KPI summaries, work queues, analytics, and quick access to start new onboarding processes.

## Component Details

### Location
`force-app/main/default/lwc/onboardingHomeDashboard/`

### Purpose
Central dashboard for managing and monitoring onboarding activities. Designed as the primary entry point for Sales Reps, Onboarding Reps, Sales Managers, and Executives.

## Features

### KPI Summary Cards
Displays key metrics at a glance via the `onboardingKpiRow` component:
- **Active Dealer Onboarding**: Count of active onboarding records (excluding Complete, Denied, Expired)
- **Completed This Period**: Count of completed onboarding within the selected time range
- **Active Vendor Programs**: Count of active vendor programs
- **Dealers Onboarded**: Total count of dealers that have completed onboarding
- **Blocked / At Risk**: Count of onboarding records that are blocked or at risk

Each card is clickable and navigates to the relevant tab with appropriate filters applied.

### Global Filters
The `onboardingFilterChips` component provides:
- **Time Range**: Last 30 Days, Last 90 Days, Year to Date, All Time
- **Vendor**: Filter by specific vendors (single-select combobox)
- **Vendor Program**: Filter by specific vendor programs (single-select combobox)
- **View**: My View, My Team, Org Wide (permission-gated)

All filters are applied across all tabs and components.

### Tabbed Work Queues

#### My Active Dealer Onboarding Tab
Shows active onboarding records created by the current user:
- Uses `onboardingWorkQueue` component with row highlighting
- Red border: Blocked records
- Yellow border: At-risk records
- Blue border: Normal records
- Columns: Account, Vendor Program, Status, Age (days), Last Modified, Actions
- Row actions: View, Resume, Requirements

#### Eligible Dealers Tab
Displays accounts that can start new onboarding processes:
- Account name, Territory, Region
- Eligible vendor count
- Row actions: Start Onboarding, View Account

**How Eligibility is Determined:**
- Uses `VendorOnboardingService.getEligibleVendors()` to check each account
- Returns accounts with active vendor programs that haven't been onboarded yet
- Respects prerequisite requirements and existing onboarding records

#### Vendor Programs Tab
Card grid layout showing vendor program health metrics:
- Program name, Vendor, Status badge
- Dealer counts (onboarded, in progress, blocked)
- Requirement progress bar
- Health indicators: Rules Engine status, Dependencies status
- Action buttons: View Program, Launch Wizard

#### Team / Org Queue Tab (Conditional)
Visible only when View filter is set to "My Team" or "Org Wide":
- Shows onboarding records for team members or entire org
- Same columns and functionality as "My Active Onboarding"
- Respects Account sharing rules

#### Insights Tab
Analytics and visualizations:
- Status distribution chart
- Onboarding funnel visualization
- Vendor program metrics overview
- Uses `onboardingInsights` component

### Recent Activity Sidebar
Timeline-style activity feed showing:
- Time ago (e.g., "5m", "2h", "3d")
- Activity summary with account and vendor program
- Actor (user who made the change)
- Color-coded: Green (completions), Orange (blocks), Blue (neutral)
- Clickable links to navigate to records

### Quick Actions
- **Start Onboarding Vendor Program**: Opens vendor program onboarding wizard
- **Start Dealer Onboarding**: Opens modal to select an account and initiate onboarding
- **Sync Component Library**: Populates Component Library with wizard components
- **Initialize Default Process**: Creates default Vendor Program Onboarding process
- **Refresh**: Reloads all dashboard data

### Admin Configuration Shortcuts (Permission-Gated)
Visible only to users with admin permissions:
- **Manage Requirements**: Navigate to requirements management
- **Manage Status Rules**: Navigate to status rules engine
- **Stage Dependencies**: Navigate to stage dependency management
- **Vendor Program Wizard**: Open vendor program onboarding wizard
- **Component Library**: Navigate to component library

## Design Decisions

### CreatedBy vs OwnerId

The component uses `CreatedById` instead of `OwnerId` because:

1. **No Owner Field**: `Onboarding__c` is a Master-Detail to Account with `ControlledByParent` sharing. Master-Detail objects don't have Owner fields by default.

2. **Account-Based Sharing**: Access to onboarding records is controlled by the parent Account's sharing rules. All users with access to the Account can see its onboarding records.

3. **Collaborative Workflow**: Multiple users may work on onboarding requirements simultaneously. Using `CreatedById` allows tracking who initiated the onboarding while allowing team collaboration.

4. **Natural Filtering**: "My Active Onboarding" naturally shows records created by the current user, which is typically what users want to see.

### Data Filtering

- **My Active Onboarding**: Shows records where `CreatedById = currentUserId`
- **Summary Statistics**: Aggregates counts for records created by current user
- **All Active Onboarding**: Available via `getAllActiveOnboarding()` method for admins/managers (not exposed in UI by default)

### Performance Considerations

- All Apex methods are `@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)` for client-side caching
- Result sets are limited to prevent large data loads (20 records for active, 50 for all, 10 for recent)
- Bulk queries where possible (e.g., checking eligible vendors for multiple accounts)
- Uses `@wire` decorators for automatic data loading and refresh

## Security

- All Apex methods use `with sharing` to respect Account sharing rules
- Users only see onboarding records for Accounts they have access to
- Summary statistics are scoped to records created by the current user
- Sharing is controlled by the Account parent (ControlledByParent)

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing
- Verify user has access to Account records
- Check that onboarding records exist and were created by the user (for "My" views)
- Ensure VendorOnboardingService is accessible for eligible accounts check

### Eligible Accounts Empty
- Verify accounts exist
- Check that active vendor programs exist
- Ensure VendorOnboardingService can access required objects

### Performance Issues
- Review result set limits
- Check for large numbers of onboarding records
- Consider adding additional filtering options
