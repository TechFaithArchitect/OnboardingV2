🎯 Onboarding Application Framework

A metadata-driven Lightning Web Component (LWC) onboarding engine designed to guide users through structured onboarding flows, such as Vendor Program onboarding. Built for configurability, auditability, and dynamic rendering of components based on admin-defined processes.

📐 Architecture Overview

This framework replaces hardcoded onboarding flows with configurable records using Custom Objects. Admins define:
- What components to show
- In what order
- Whether each stage is required
- What happens after each stage

Users are then dynamically walked through those stages. Progress is saved and auditable.

🔁 Use Case: Vendor Program Onboarding

For each Vendor Program, users are guided through a dynamic onboarding flow like:
1. Select Vendor
2. Choose/Create Program
3. Assign Program Group
4. Assign Requirement Group
5. Finalize Program
6. Choose Recipient Group
7. Add Members

Each of these is a standalone LWC, orchestrated via metadata.

🧩 Components

onboardingFlowEngine
- Main controller. Dynamically loads each onboarding stage (LWC) based on metadata.

onboardingStageRenderer
- Wraps the dynamic instantiation of stage components based on their API name.

vendorProgramOnboardingFlow
- Vendor-specific wrapper that:
  - Accepts recordId (Vendor Program)
  - Queries for onboarding process via Apex
  - Injects processId into the engine

⚙️ Apex Service

OnboardingApplicationService.cls
- Fetches process/stage metadata
- Saves user progress
- Logs completed stages
- Resolves process assignment for a vendor program
